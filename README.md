## 🔍 Key Insights (Storytelling Style)
📌 **Appointments at Risk**:  
- 200 total → **52 No-shows** + **51 Cancellations** = 📉 Almost **50% lost revenue opportunities**  

📌 **Revenue Reality Check**:  
- Total revenue: **551K**  
- Paid: **173K** | Pending: **185K** | Failed: **193K**  
- ⚠️ >65% of revenue not collected  

📌 **Doctor Performance**:  
- **Jane Smith** leads with **95K revenue** despite fewer appointments  
- Some doctors (Sarah Taylor, David Taylor) have **high patient counts but low revenue** → signals need for performance review  

📌 **Branch Comparison**:  
- Central Hospital has most appointments,  
- But **Westside Clinic** earns nearly as much revenue with fewer visits = **better efficiency**  

📌 **Treatment Profitability**:  
- Chemotherapy & MRI = top earners  
- Emergency visits = lowest revenue per appointment
